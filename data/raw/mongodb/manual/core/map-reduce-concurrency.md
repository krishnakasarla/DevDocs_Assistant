# Map-Reduce Concurrency

**Note: Aggregation Pipeline as an Alternative to Map-Reduce**

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, [map-reduce](/docs/manual/core/map-reduce#std-label-map-reduce) is deprecated:

- Instead of [map-reduce](/docs/manual/core/map-reduce#std-label-map-reduce), you should use an [aggregation pipeline](/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline#std-label-aggregation-pipeline). Aggregation pipelines provide better performance and usability than map-reduce.

- You can rewrite map-reduce operations using [aggregation pipeline stages](/docs/manual/reference/mql/aggregation-stages#std-label-aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference), such as [`$group`](/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-group), [`$merge`](/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-merge), and others.

- For map-reduce operations that require custom functionality, you can use the [`$accumulator`](/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/accumulator#mongodb-group-grp.-accumulator) and [`$function`](/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/function#mongodb-expression-exp.-function) aggregation operators. You can use those operators to define custom aggregation expressions in JavaScript.

For examples of aggregation pipeline alternatives to map-reduce, see:

- [Map-Reduce to Aggregation Pipeline](/docs/manual/reference/map-reduce-to-aggregation-pipeline#std-label-map-reduce-to-agg-pipeline)

- [Map-Reduce Examples](/docs/manual/tutorial/map-reduce-examples#std-label-map-reduce-examples)

The map-reduce operation is composed of many tasks, including reads from the input collection, executions of the `map` function, executions of the `reduce` function, writes to a temporary collection during processing, and writes to the output collection.

During the operation, map-reduce takes the following locks:

- The read phase takes a read lock.  It yields every 100 documents.

- The insert into the temporary collection takes a write lock for a single write.

- If the output collection does not exist, the creation of the output collection takes a write lock.

- If the output collection exists, then the output actions (i.e. `merge`, `replace`, `reduce`) take a write lock. This write lock is *global*, and blocks all operations on the [`mongod`](/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) instance.
