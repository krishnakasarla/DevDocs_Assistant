# Define Location Range for a 2d Index

You can define the range of coordinates included in a [2d index](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/geospatial/2d#std-label-2d-index). By default, 2d indexes have longitude and latitude boundaries of:

- Greater than or equal to `-180`

- Less than `180`

To change the location range of a 2d index, specify the `min` and `max` options when you create the index:

```javascript
db.<collection>.createIndex(
   {
      <location field>: "2d"
   },
   {
      min: <lower bound>,
      max: <upper bound>
   }
)
```

The `min` and `max` bounds are **inclusive** and apply to both longitude and latitude.

## About this Task

**Important:**

The default location bounds for 2d indexes allow latitudes less than -90 and greater than 90, which are invalid values. The behavior of geospatial queries with these invalid points is not defined.

Defining a smaller location range for a 2d index reduces the amount of data stored in the index, and can improve query performance.

You cannot create a 2d index if your collection contains coordinate data outside of the index's location range.

After you create a 2d index, you cannot insert a document that contains coordinate data outside of the index's location range.

## Before You Begin

Create the `contacts` collection:

```javascript
db.contacts.insertMany( [
   {
      name: "Evander Otylia",
      phone: "202-555-0193",
      address: [ 55.5, 42.3 ]
   },
   {
      name: "Georgine Lestaw",
      phone: "714-555-0107",
      address: [ -74, 44.74 ]
   }
] )
```

The `address` field contains [legacy coordinate pairs.](/docs/manual/geospatial-queries#std-label-geospatial-legacy)

## Procedure

Create a 2d index on the `address` field. Specify the following location bounds:

- `min` bound of `-75`

- `max` bound of `60`

```javascript
db.contacts.createIndex(
   {
      address: "2d"
   },
   {
      min: -75,
      max: 60
   }
)
```

## Results

The index covers a smaller location range and has increased performance than a default 2d index.

After you create the index, you cannot insert a document that contains coordinate data outside of the index's location range. For example, you **cannot** insert the following document:

```javascript
db.contacts.insertOne(
   {
      name: "Paige Polson",
      phone: "402-555-0190",
      address: [ 70, 42.3 ]
   }
)
```

The `address` field has a longitude value of `70`, which is higher than the `max` bound of `60`.

## Next Steps

You can use the 2d index to perform calculations on location data, such as [proximity queries.](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/geospatial/2d/query/proximity-flat-surface#std-label-2d-index-proximity-query)
