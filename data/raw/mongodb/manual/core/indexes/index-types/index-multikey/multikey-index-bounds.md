# Multikey Index Bounds

**Index bounds** define the range of index values that MongoDB searches when using an index to fulfill a query. When you specify multiple query predicates on an indexed field, MongoDB attempts to combine the bounds for those predicates to produce an index scan with smaller bounds. Smaller index bounds result in faster queries and reduced resource use.

MongoDB combines bounds by either [intersecting](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-multikey/multikey-index-bounds#std-label-multikey-index-bounds-intersecting) or [compounding](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-multikey/multikey-index-bounds#std-label-multikey-index-bounds-compound) bounds.

## Bounds Intersection for a Multikey Index

Bounds intersection refers to the point where multiple bounds overlap. For example, given the bounds `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]` and `[ [
-Infinity, 6 ] ]`, the intersection of the bounds results in `[ [ 3, 6
] ]`.

Given an indexed array field, consider a query that specifies multiple query predicates on the array and uses a [multikey index](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-multikey#std-label-index-type-multikey) to fulfill the query. MongoDB can intersect the multikey index bounds if an [`$elemMatch`](/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/elemMatch#mongodb-query-op.-elemMatch) operator joins the query predicates.

### Example: Bounds Intersection

The following example shows how MongoDB uses bounds intersection to define a smaller range of values to query, resulting in improved query performance.

1. Populate a sample collection

   Create a `students` collection that contains documents with a field `name` and an array field `grades`:

   ```javascript
   db.students.insertMany(
      [
         { _id: 1, name: "Shawn", grades: [ 70, 85 ] },
         { _id: 2, item: "Elena", grades: [ 92, 84 ] }
      ]
   )
   ```

2. Create a multikey index

   Create a [multikey index](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-multikey#std-label-index-type-multikey) on the `grades` array:

   ```javascript
   db.students.createIndex( { grades: 1 } )
   ```

3. Query the collection

   Run the following query:

   ```javascript
   db.students.find( { grades : { $elemMatch: { $gte: 90, $lte: 99 } } } )
   ```

   The preceding query uses `$elemMatch` to return documents where the `grades` array contains at least one element that matches *both* of the specified conditions.

   Taking the query predicates separately:

   - The bounds for the greater than or equal to 90 predicate (`$gte: 90`) are `[ [ 90, Infinity ] ]`.

   - The bounds for the less than or equal to 99 predicate (`$lte:
     99`) are `[ [ -Infinity, 99 ] ]`.

   Because the query uses `$elemMatch` to join these predicates, MongoDB intersects the bounds to:

   ```javascript
   ratings: [ [ 90, 99 ] ]
   ```

### Query without $elemMatch

If the query does not join the conditions on the array field with `$elemMatch`, MongoDB cannot intersect the multikey index bounds.

Consider this query:

```javascript
db.students.find( { grades: { $gte: 90, $lte: 99 } } )
```

The query searches the `grades` array for:

- At least one element greater than or equal to `90`

- At least one element less than or equal to `99`

The same element can satisfy both criteria.

Because the preceding query does not use `$elemMatch`, MongoDB does not intersect the bounds. Instead, MongoDB uses either of the following bounds:

- `[ [ 90, Infinity ] ]`

- `[ [ -Infinity, 99 ] ]`

MongoDB makes no guarantee as to which of the two bounds it chooses.

## Compound Bounds for a Multikey Index

Compound bounds combine bounds for multiple keys of a [compound index](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-compound#std-label-index-type-compound). Using bounds from multiple keys reduces the time it takes to process a query because MongoDB does not need to compute results for each bound individually.

For example, consider a compound index `{ temperature: 1, humidity: 1
}` with the following bounds:

- `temperature` has a bound of `[ [ 80, Infinity ] ]`.

- `humidity` has a bound of `[ [ -Infinity, 20 ] ]`.

Compounding the bounds results in the use of both bounds:

```javascript
{ temperature: [ [ 80, Infinity ] ], humidity: [ [ -Infinity, 20 ] ] }
```

If MongoDB cannot compound the two bounds, MongoDB constrains the index scan by the bound on the leading field. In this example, the leading field is `temperature`, resulting in a constraint of `temperature: [ [ 80, Infinity ] ]`.

### Example: Compound Bounds of Non-array Field and Array Field

The following example shows how MongoDB uses compound bounds to define a more efficient query constraint, resulting in improved query performance.

1. Populate a sample collection

   Create a `survey` collection that contains documents with a field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

   ```javascript
   db.survey.insertMany(
      [
         { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] },
         { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }
      ]
   )
   ```

2. Create a compound multikey index

   Create a [compound multikey index](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-compound#std-label-index-type-compound) on the `item` and `ratings` fields:

   ```javascript
   db.survey.createIndex( { item: 1, ratings: 1 } )
   ```

3. Query the collection

   Run the following query:

   ```javascript
   db.survey.find( { item: "XYZ", ratings: { $gte: 3 } } )
   ```

   The preceding query specifies a condition on both keys of the index (`item` and `ratings`).

   Taking the predicates separately:

   - The bounds for the `item: "XYZ"` predicate are `[ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ]]`.

   - The bounds for the `ratings: { $gte: 3 }` predicate are `[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]`.

   MongoDB uses the combined bounds of:

   ```javascript
   { item: [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ], ratings: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ] }
   ```

### Example: Compound Bounds of Non-array Field and Multiple Array Fields

The following example shows how MongoDB uses compound bounds when an index includes a non-array field and multiple array fields.

1. Populate a sample collection

   Create a `survey2` collection that contains documents with a string field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

   ```javascript
   db.survey2.insertMany( [
      {
         _id: 1,
         item: "ABC",
         ratings: [ { score: 2, by: "mn" }, { score: 9, by: "anon" } ]
      },
      {
         _id: 2,
         item: "XYZ",
         ratings: [ { score: 5, by: "anon" }, { score: 7, by: "wv" } ]
      }
   ] )
   ```

2. Create a compound multikey index

   Create a compound index on the following fields:

   - `item` (non-array)

   - `ratings.score` (array)

   - `ratings.by` (array)

   ```javascript
   db.survey2.createIndex(
      {
         "item": 1,
         "ratings.score": 1,
         "ratings.by": 1
      }
   )
   ```

3. Query the collection

   Run the following query:

   ```javascript
   db.survey2.find(
      {
         item: "XYZ",
         "ratings.score": { $lte: 5 },
         "ratings.by": "anon"
      }
   )
   ```

   Taking the predicates separately:

   - The bounds for the `item: "XYZ"` predicate are `[ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ]`.

   - The bounds for the `score: { $lte: 5 }` predicate are `[ [ -Infinity, 5] ]`.

   - The bounds for the `by: "anon"` predicate are `[ "anon", "anon" ]`.

   MongoDB compounds the bounds for the `item` key with either the bounds for `"ratings.score"` or the bounds for `"ratings.by"`, depending upon the query predicates and the index key values. MongoDB does not guarantee which bounds it compounds with the `item` field.

   MongoDB fulfills the query in one of the following ways:

   - MongoDB compounds the `item` bounds with the `"ratings.score"` bounds:

     ```javascript
     {
        "item" : [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ],
        "ratings.score" : [ [ -Infinity, 5 ] ],
        "ratings.by" : [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ]
     }
     ```

   - MongoDB compounds the `item` bounds with the `"ratings.by"` bounds:

     ```javascript
     {
        "item" : [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ],
        "ratings.score" : [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ],
        "ratings.by" : [ [ "anon", "anon" ] ]
     }
     ```

   To compound the bounds for `"ratings.score"` with the bounds for `"ratings.by"`, the query must use `$elemMatch`.

### Compound Bounds of Multiple Fields from the Same Array

To compound the bounds for index keys from the same array, both of the following must be true:

- The index keys must share the same field path up to but excluding the field names.

- The query must specify predicates on the fields using `$elemMatch` on that path.

For a field in an embedded document, the [dotted field name](/docs/manual/core/document#std-label-document-dot-notation), such as `"a.b.c.d"`, is the field path for `d`. To compound the bounds for index keys from the same array, the `$elemMatch` must be on the path up to *but excluding* the field name itself (meaning `"a.b.c"`).

#### Example

The following example shows how MongoDB combines bounds for index keys from the same array. This example uses the `survey2` collection used in the [previous example.](/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-multikey/multikey-index-bounds#std-label-index-bounds-example-non-array-multiple-array)

1. Create a compound multikey index

   Create a compound index on the `ratings.score` and the `ratings.by` fields:

   ```javascript
   db.survey2.createIndex( { "ratings.score": 1, "ratings.by": 1 } )
   ```

   The fields `"ratings.score"` and `"ratings.by"` share the field path `ratings`.

2. Query the collection

   Run the following query:

   ```javascript
   db.survey2.find( { ratings: { $elemMatch: { score: { $lte: 5 }, by: "anon" } } } )
   ```

   The preceding query uses `$elemMatch` on the `ratings` field to require that the array contains at least one *single* element that matches both conditions.

   Taking the predicates separately:

   - The bounds for the `score: { $lte: 5 }` predicate are `[ [ -Infinity, 5 ] ]`.

   - The bounds for the `by: "anon"` predicate are `[ [ "anon", "anon" ] ]`.

   MongoDB compounds the two bounds to the following bounds:

   ```javascript
   { "ratings.score" : [ [ -Infinity, 5 ] ], "ratings.by" : [ [ "anon", "anon" ] ] }
   ```

### Example: $elemMatch on Diverging Field Paths

If your query specifies `$elemMatch` on fields that diverge from a common path, MongoDB **cannot** compound the bounds of index keys from the same array.

The following example demonstrates `$elemMatch` on diverging field paths.

1. Populate a sample collection

   Create a collection `survey3` contains documents with a string field `item` and an array field `ratings`:

   ```javascript
   db.survey3.insertMany( [
      {
         _id: 1,
         item: "ABC",
         ratings: [
            { scores: [ { q1: 2, q2: 4 }, { q1: 3, q2: 8 } ], loc: "A" },
            { scores: [ { q1: 2, q2: 5 } ], loc: "B" }
         ]
      },
      {
         _id: 2,
         item: "XYZ",
         ratings: [
            { scores: [ { q1: 7 }, { q1: 2, q2: 8 } ], loc: "B" }
         ]
      }
   ] )
   ```

2. Create a compound multikey index

   Create a compound index on the `ratings.scores.q1` and the `ratings.scores.q2` fields:

   ```javascript
   db.survey3.createIndex( { "ratings.scores.q1": 1, "ratings.scores.q2": 1 } )
   ```

   The fields `"ratings.scores.q1"` and `"ratings.scores.q2"` share the field path `"ratings.scores"`. In order to compound index bounds, a query must use `$elemMatch` on the common field path.

3. Query the collection

   The following query uses an `$elemMatch` *not* on the required path:

   ```javascript
   db.survey3.find( { ratings: { $elemMatch: { 'scores.q1': 2, 'scores.q2': 8 } } } )
   ```

   MongoDB cannot compound the index bounds and the `"ratings.scores.q2"` field is unconstrained during the index scan.

   To compound the bounds, the query must use `$elemMatch` on the common path `"ratings.scores"`:

   ```javascript
   db.survey3.find( { 'ratings.scores': { $elemMatch: { 'q1': 2, 'q2': 8 } } } )
   ```
